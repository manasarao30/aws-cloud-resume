Developed and deployed a personal resume website on AWS, utilizing HTML/CSS for a static site hosted on an S3
bucket, secured and distributed globally with CloudFront and HTTPS. Implemented a serverless visitor counter using an AWS Lambda function that interacts with a DynamoDB table
via an API Gateway, enhancing the functionality and tracking site visits. Managed the entire cloud infrastructure as code(IaC) using Terraform, ensuring consistency, scalability, and
adherence to best practices in cloud infrastructure. (Infrastructure-as-code). Automated the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to streamline the deployment process.
